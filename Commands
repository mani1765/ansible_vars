Pass varibales values at run time

ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --extra-vars '{"version":"1.0"}'

Here in the above version varibae is defined in playbook.yml file but value is not present in vars.yml file

-> we can specify multiple var files in playbook.yml file
-> Note ansible give high priority to run time variables example:- if version value is already present in vars.yml file but you passed different value at run time for version it will take run time varibale only.


we can pass variables file at run time like below

ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml --extra-vars '@other_vars.yml'
